Changes were made to the twig templates, all templates are universal and reusable, which allowed us to reduce the development of the site and reduce the number of templates by 3-4 times. Added a context mechanism, like in ShopWare 6, but implemented in its own way. Each page is filled with its own context and displays only the necessary information for the page. Added translations. Convenient addition of new blocks, such as skills, projects, contacts.",

Challenges I faced: Incorporating ApiPlatform alongside Symfony might have introduced challenges in terms of setting up RESTful APIs, handling data serialization/deserialization, and ensuring compatibility with React frontend. Developing complex API endpoints to cater to various frontend requirements and business logic could have been challenging. Integrating React frontend with ApiPlatform backend while using TypeScript might have required additional effort to ensure type safety and consistency across the application.",

Understanding the concept of context and repositories in the context of Shopware 6's architecture might have posed challenges, particularly in terms of integrating custom functionality into the existing system.
